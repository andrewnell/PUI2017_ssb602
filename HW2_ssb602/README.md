The assignment helps in understanding how todeal with different types of data files such as csv and json
There two parts to this assignment:

Part 1 and 2: Working with json file
I have completed both the parts on my own.

The json file contained data regarding MTA buses. To access this data we need to use the API key.
The json file was a nested dictionary which comprised of dictionaries and list of dictionaries.The aim of the first part was to read the data for a particular bus line which was provided as a commandline argument and its location. The second part comprised of finding the next stop for agiven bus line.

This assignment helped in understanding reading and handling of json filesusing python pandas. Another concept that was learnt was the command line arguments.

Part 3: Working with csv files
I have completed this part on my own.

The csv file was read from CUSP Data Hub Facility using the environmental variable.
The dataset that I worked on was that of the DSNY that included cleaning report for the month of January which comprised of 8 columns and 299 records. I have used the Dustrict and Lot column for scatter plot.

For the extra credit I have used the Status Date and District columns for plotting
