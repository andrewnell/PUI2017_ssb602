This assignment is completed by working together with Ilha.

For HW3 - Assignment 1: 
I and Ilha tried to understand how to use numpy.random to get various distributions.
We did the Chi square and Normal distribution together. Decided to take Rayleigh as the fifth distribution.
Poisson, Binomial and Rayleigh was done individually. Also the histogram of sample means of all distribution was done individually.

For HW3 - Assignment 2:
After looking at the Citi Bike data, I and Ilha came up with two different hypothesis. Hence we decided to implemet our own ideas.
We discussed our individual hypothesis and performed required coding individually.

For HW3 -  Assignment 3:
I have completed this assignment on my own.
